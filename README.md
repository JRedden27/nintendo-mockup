Web Development Project | Nintendo Mockup

https://jredden27.github.io/nintendo-mockup/

•	This was developed as a two-day class project, in which students were asked to choose any website and imitate it as closely as possible. I chose the Nintendo website for my project.
•	My version reflects the advertisements and imagery that were on display at the time of my projects’ creation.
•	My site was created from scratch as a React project, also utilizing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
•	Some components were based off those found in the react-bootstrap library, with some variation to more closely match those found on the original site.
•	I had the site hosted using GitHub Pages, so that the site would be visible to anyone who wished to see it.
